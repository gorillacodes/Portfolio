			<h3>Tinder Clone</h3>

			<p>
				This was a project I started when I first learned Reactjs. I was the
				sole creator/developer for this project.
				<br />
				<br />
				It is the clone of the most popular dating app Tinder, made by using
				React.js and other front-end Technologies.
				<br />
				<br />
				Basically, it is just the UI part of the actual tinder app and further i
				am planing to do make it a real world working app by using MERN stack
				Technologies.
				<br />
				<br />
				Also, in near furture i will deploy this, make it online and i've
				planned to add couple of features of my own that i think should be
				present in a dating app.
				<br />

			<p>
				This was a project I started when I first learned Reactjs. I was the
				sole creator/developer for this project. Basically, An instagram-like
				photo gallery app, made by using Reactjs & Firebase.
				<br />
				<br />
				The idea behind making this app is to create a instagram look a like
				photo gallery app in which one can upload pictures and they are stored
				in the databse for that i have used firebase.
				<br />
				<br />

				<br />
				<br />

			<h3>Character Counter</h3>

			<p>
				This was a project I started a long ago when i started learning the 3
				basic blocks of web development that is HTML, CSS, Javascript. I was the
				sole creator/developer for this project.
				<br />
				<br />
				As the name suggests, the character counter is a tool to count the
				number of characters, words, sentences, and paragraphs in your text on
				any type of online or social media platform. It is an easy to use tool
				via simply typing the text or by copying and pasting the text in the
				text area after which the counter will generate the result on clicking
				“Count” and the number of characters, words, sentences, and paragraphs
				will be displayed instantly.
				<br />
				<br />

				<br />
				<br />
				The idea behind making this app is that people can count the characters
				that they are going to write in there captions on social media or this
				will also help people while writing long esays.
				<br />
